By default,\n              DVC is configured to use a local data storage only (.dvc/cache\n              directory), which enables basic DVC usage scenarios out of the\n              box. DVC can use cloud storage as a common file storage. With\n              cloud storage, you might use models and data files which were\n              created by your team members without spending time and resources\n              to re-build models and re-process data files. As of this version,\n              DVC supports two types of cloud-based storage providers:\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  <Definition>AWS</Definition> - Amazon Web Services\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  <Definition>GCP</Definition> - Google Cloud Platform The\n                  subsections below explain how to configure DVC to use each of\n                  them.
