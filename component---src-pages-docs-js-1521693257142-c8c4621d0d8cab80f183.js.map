By default,\n              DVC is configured to use a local data storage only (.dvc/cache\n              directory), which enables basic DVC usage scenarios out of the\n              box. DVC can use cloud storage as a common file storage. With\n              cloud storage, you might use models and data files which were\n              created by your team members without spending time and resources\n              to re-build models and re-process data files.
